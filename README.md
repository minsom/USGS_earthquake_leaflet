Visualizing USGS Earthquake Data with Leaflet<br>

The below map uses JavaScript library 'Leaflet' to visualize fault lines and earthquake data collected in the last seven days.
Data on tectonic plates can be found at <a href="https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates" target="_blank">https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates</a>.  Earthquake data is updated every day and is from the <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">United States Geological Survey (USGS)</a>.
        
  * <b>Markers</b> reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.
  * <b>Popups</b> provide additional information (location, magnitude, time) about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
  * <b>Legend</b> describes color scales of earthquake magnitude.
  * <b>Layer controls</b> at the top-right corner allow users to choose from three base maps. Faults lines and earthquake datasets are overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
